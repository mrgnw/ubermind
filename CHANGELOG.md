# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.5] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Port detection in status**: Running processes now show which TCP ports they're listening on
  - Automatically detects listening ports via system APIs (no configuration needed)
  - Resolves child process ports through process group expansion (handles `sh -c` wrappers)
  - Displayed in CLI status output and web UI
  - Available in HTTP API responses (`ports` field on process info)

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Auto-watch after modifications**: Commands that modify services now automatically watch status for 4 seconds
  - `ub start myapp` — automatically watches for 4s after starting
  - `ub stop myapp` — automatically watches for 4s after stopping
  - `ub reload myapp` — automatically watches for 4s after reloading
  - `ub restart myapp web` — automatically watches for 4s after restarting a process
  - Override default: `ub start myapp --watch 8` (custom duration)
  - Disable watch: `ub start myapp --watch 0`
- **Continuous echo streaming**: `ub echo` now runs continuously until stopped (Ctrl+C)
  - Previously only printed one snapshot then exited
  - Now properly streams live logs in real-time
- **Simplified `ub add` command**: Register projects more easily
  - `ub add` (from project dir) — auto-detects name from directory
  - `ub add myapp` (from project dir) — uses cwd with custom name
  - `ub add myapp ~/dev/myapp` — full form with explicit path

### Changed

- **Watch duration defaults**: Different defaults for different commands
  - `ub status --watch` — indefinite (until stopped), 1s refresh interval
  - `ub start/stop/reload/restart` — automatic 4s watch
  - All watch durations can be overridden with explicit values

### Fixed

- Echo command now properly loops and streams output continuously
- Watch mode default duration logic fixed for status vs modification commands

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **`tail` command**: Follow log files in real-time (`ub tail matrix.automation`)
- **Dot syntax targeting**: Use `service.process` to target a specific process
  - `ub status matrix.automation` — show only the automation process
  - `ub logs matrix.baibot` — view logs for a specific process
  - `.process` shorthand from within a project directory (e.g., `ub status .api`)
- **`--watch` / `-w` flag**: Live-updating status display
  - `ub status matrix -w` — watch for 4s (default), refresh every 1s
  - `ub status --all -w 10` — watch all services for 10s
  - `ub start matrix -w` — start then watch status
  - `--watch-interval N` to customize refresh rate
  - Uses cursor-up rewrite for flicker-free updates
- **Human-readable uptime**: `6h10m` instead of `22255s`
- **Text status labels**: `on`, `off`, `failed`, `crashed` as a final column
- **Color distinction**: Crashed processes (retrying) shown in yellow vs failed (terminal) in red

## [0.6.0] - TBD

### Changed

**Complete rewrite: Native Rust process supervision**

ubermind v0.6 removes all dependencies on overmind and tmux, replacing them with native Rust process management:

- **Native process supervision**: Direct PID-based process management without external dependencies
- **Auto-restart**: Configurable crash recovery with retry limits
- **Log management**: Automatic log rotation with timestamped files
- **Live streaming**: Ring buffers for real-time log output
- **Unified daemon**: Single daemon handles both process supervision and web UI
- **No external dependencies**: No longer requires overmind or tmux installation

### Breaking Changes

- Configuration format and APIs may differ from v0.5
- Migration from v0.5 projects should be straightforward (same Procfile format)
- Users upgrading should review the new documentation

### For Users of v0.1-v0.5

Earlier versions of ubermind were thin wrappers around [overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind). Version 0.6 represents a complete architectural shift to native process management while maintaining the same user-facing Procfile format and CLI commands.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-02-14

### Added

- Shell autocomplete for bash, zsh, and fish
  - Completes commands: `start`, `stop`, `status`, `restart`, etc.
  - Completes project names from config
  - Completes flags: `--all`, `-a`, `--daemon`, etc.
  - Example: `ub start appli<tab>` → `ub start appligator`
  - Install script automatically downloads completion files
  - Completions available in `completions/` directory

## [0.4.0] - 2024-12-19

### Changed

**Configuration file names renamed for clarity**

- `~/.config/ubermind/services` → `~/.config/ubermind/projects`
  - Clarifies that each entry is a project directory with its own Procfile
  
- `~/.config/ubermind/Procfile` → `~/.config/ubermind/commands`
  - Distinguishes ubermind's config from actual project Procfiles
  - Uses Procfile format for standalone commands
  
- `~/.config/ubermind/proc/` → `~/.config/ubermind/_commands/`
  - Underscore prefix signals this is an internal/auto-generated directory

### Improved

- Clearer mental model: **projects** (mapped directories) vs **commands** (standalone entries)
- Better documentation explaining the two-layer architecture
- All user-facing output now uses consistent "projects" terminology
- UI displays "No projects configured" message
- Help text and error messages updated throughout

### Technical

- Renamed `load_config_services()` → `load_projects()`
- Renamed `load_procfile_services()` → `load_commands()`
- Added `projects_config_path()` helper function
- Updated UI backend to use projects config path
- No API changes - internal refactoring only

## [0.3.5] - 2024-01-XX

### Added

- Initial stable release
- Multi-project management with Procfile support
- Web UI for monitoring and control
- Built on overmind/tmux (later replaced in v0.6)
